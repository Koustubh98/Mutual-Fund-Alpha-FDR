# Mutual-Fund-Alpha-FDR
# üìä Random Gains or Real Gains?  
## Using False Discovery Rate (FDR) to Evaluate Mutual Fund Returns

This project investigates whether the outperformance of mutual funds is driven by **managerial skill** or merely **luck**. We apply the **Fama-French 3-Factor** and **Carhart 4-Factor** models to estimate alpha values across 77 mutual funds, and then assess statistical significance using the **False Discovery Rate (FDR)** correction method.

## üß™ Objective

To statistically evaluate whether the excess returns (alpha) generated by mutual funds from 2018 to 2022 are the result of **manager expertise** or **random chance**, using:

- Fama-French 3-Factor Model  
- Carhart 4-Factor Model  
- Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for False Discovery Rate control

## üìö Methodology

### 1. Data

- Monthly returns for **77 mutual funds** (2018 ‚Äì March 2022)
- Factor data:  
  - **MKT** ‚Äì Market excess return  
  - **SMB** ‚Äì Small Minus Big (Size Premium)  
  - **HML** ‚Äì High Minus Low (Value Premium)  
  - **WML** ‚Äì Winners Minus Losers (Momentum)  
  - **RF** ‚Äì Risk-free rate

### 2. Alpha Estimation

For each fund, we estimate the **alpha (intercept)** using linear regression:

- **3-Factor Model:**  
  `ri - rf = Œ± + Œ≤1 * MKT + Œ≤2 * SMB + Œ≤3 * HML + Œµ`

- **4-Factor Model:**  
  `ri - rf = Œ± + Œ≤1 * MKT + Œ≤2 * SMB + Œ≤3 * HML + Œ≤4 * WML + Œµ`

### 3. Significance Testing

- p-values for each alpha are calculated using `lm()` output.
- Multiple testing is handled using **Benjamini-Hochberg FDR** correction.
- Alphas with **FDR-adjusted p-values < 0.05** are considered significant.

## üìä Visualizations

The analysis includes:

- **P-value scatter plots** for both models (significance threshold lines)
- **Boxplots** of alpha distributions by fund category
- **Correlation heatmap** of Fama-French factors
- **Q-Q plot** of residuals to test normality assumptions

---

## üìâ Key Findings

- A very limited number of funds have statistically significant alpha after FDR correction.
- This suggests that most **positive returns are not due to skill**, but could be explained by **luck**.
- **Negative returns**, however, may still reflect **managerial underperformance**.

---

## üß© Limitations

- Limited sample size (77 funds)
- Data restricted to Indian mutual fund market and to monthly frequency
- The dataset and fund names are proprietary and not shared publicly

---

## üî≠ Future Scope

- Extend analysis to **different asset classes** (equity, debt, hybrid)
- Conduct **long-term performance** evaluations
- Compare with **international mutual funds**
- Explore **machine learning** alternatives to alpha estimation

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Language:** R
- **Libraries:** `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `reshape2`, `readxl`
- **Models:** Fama-French 3 & 4 Factor Models
- **Statistical Techniques:** Linear Regression, Multiple Hypothesis Testing, FDR Control
